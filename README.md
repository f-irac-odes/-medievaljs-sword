> _"Why manage components manually, when you can let the **engine** do it for you?"_  
> – Some wise developer 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to **My ECS Game Engine** – the magical world where **entities** roam free, systems take care of all the heavy lifting, and components live happily ever after! 🏰✨

## Features 🦾💡

- **ECS Awesomeness**: Build your game with an Entity Component System, because who needs OOP? 🤷‍♂️
- **Super-Smart Systems**: Let systems update your entities while you sit back and sip coffee ☕.
- **Archetype Wizards**: Create entities from archetypes like a magician conjuring spells 🧙‍♀️.
- **Event Chaos**: Built-in events to make everything more dramatic 📡🎭.
- **Deferred Magic**: Entities appear *right on time* thanks to deferred creation ⏳.
- **Query Like a Pro**: Retrieve entities like searching for your TV remote 🧐📺.
- **Custom Hooks**: Insert your special logic like a master chef 🍲👨‍🍳.

## Installation 🎉

Installing is as simple as:

```bash
npm install my-ecs-game-engine
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Don't forget to run `npm install` – your code won't magically work without it! 🧙‍♂️✨

## Getting Started 🚀👾

Here’s how you start creating your next **award-winning** game:

```typescript
import { World, Entity } from 'my-ecs-game-engine';

// Create your first epic entity
interface MyEntity extends Entity {
  position: { x: number, y: number };
  velocity: { x: number, y: number };
  health: number;
}

const world = new World<MyEntity>([
  (dt: number) => {
    world.query({ has: ['position', 'velocity'] }).entities.forEach(entity => {
      entity.position.x += entity.velocity.x * dt;
      entity.position.y += entity.velocity.y * dt;
    });
  }
]);

const player = world.createEntity({
  position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  velocity: { x: 1, y: 1 },
  health: 100, // Because you don't want your player dying too soon! 💀
});

function gameLoop(dt: number) {
  world.runSystems(dt);
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
```

> **Disclaimer**: No real entities were harmed during this loop! 🐱‍👓

## Systems and Queries 🔍🔧

Systems are your **game engine ninjas** 🥷, silently doing their job every frame. Define them and let them work their magic!

```typescript
world.addSystem((dt) => {
  const { entities } = world.query({
    has: ['position', 'velocity'],
    where: (entity) => entity.health > 0,
  });

  entities.forEach(entity => {
    entity.position.x += entity.velocity.x * dt;
    entity.position.y += entity.velocity.y * dt;
  });
});
```

## Events 🎉🎊

**Life's more fun with events!** 🎉

```typescript
world.subscribeToEvent('entityAdded', (event) => {
  console.log('🚀 Entity added:', event.entity);
});

world.emitEvent('customEvent', { message: 'Hello, World! 🌍' });
```

> Fun fact: Emitting custom events is like sending a postcard to all your entities 📬.

## Advanced Features 💼💣

- **Deferred Entity Creation**: Because some entities like to make a dramatic entrance ⌛.
- **Custom Hooks**: Use lifecycle hooks like an exclusive backstage pass to control entity behavior 🎫.
